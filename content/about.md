>"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort
>and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy" -- Martin Luther King Jr.

This quote resonates deeply with me.  I have a strong sense of community and moral
obligation to act when it is within my power to do so, despite the sacrifices
that are required.

For instance, I took a month leave of absence and volunteered for the American
Red Cross, operating a shelter in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S
in 2005.  Directly participating in the relief effort of a national disaster was
more important than any project I was involved in at that time at Merrill Lynch. Having the
capacity to help and then taking a month unpaid leave of absence to respond to a national
crisis was the right thing to do.

Further, after climbing a hard-earned career path through the major wall street
investment banks for nearly a decade, I've re-aligned my career with my core
values.  During my time in financial services, I successfully lead many projects and
initiatives across teams and business divisions in margin, risk management, product development
and IT.  I'm now (finally) dedicating all of myself to a mission that I believe will
have a positive, lasting impact in society.


## Brief Professional Summary

### Career

Darin worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch prime brokerage as a product development manager supporting the margin financing business.

## Hobbies, Interests

When I'm not working on intellectually challenging work, I'm getting my hands
dirty, from DIY home improvement projects to backpacking or camping.  

These are some of the best photos that I've taken using a basic 8MP camera at 
places I've visited in the U.S:
