A fully-functioning demonstration of a Yosai-secured pyramid application is 
[available from github](https://github.com/YosaiProject/monster_rx).  

The project is called MonsterRX, as in "Monster Prescription".  It's a basic 
workflow application for medical prescriptions.  It's intended for Monster use,
