## Announcement

I am pleased to announce my first Rust tutorial, available through a [general Rust tutorials project](http://www.daringordon.com/tutorials-rs/).  The tutorial is intended to help beginners to Rust who are interested in learning Rust concepts through their application.  The subject of the tutorial is my first Rust project, [authz](https://github.com/Dowwie/rust-authz).


## Rust Tutorials

The tutorials project is a *community resource*.  The content is largely from documentation, blog posts, and ad-hoc contributions from the Rustacean-leaders at #rust-beginners on irc.mozilla.org.  Since this is a community resource, I encourage contributions of all kinds.  The tutorials project is *yours* as much as it is mine.  Author a tutorial and we'll publish it together in the landing page (and move the web site domain).

## Learning By Teaching

There is a principle of learning that if you would like to learn a subject well, teach it.  This work is a milestone in my learning of Rust because of this principle.  About a month ago, I began to learn Rust.  With a lot of help from the Rust community, I've released my first library as an open source crate, written a Python extension to the library, and now conclude this chapter by introducing a tutorial based on the library.  Teaching what I've learned pushed me to go further and connect ideas that I hadn't.  I believe it was a very important step in my learning and development.  It was so valuable of an experience that I feel compelled to encourage anyone reading this to give writing a tutorial a try.

## About the Tutorial

For the tutorial, I chose [code written in Python](https://github.com/YosaiProject/yosai/blob/master/yosai/core/authz/authz.py#L37) that has the potential to become computationally expensive.  The logic isn't too complicated yet the code requires enough concepts that I thought it would be a good entrypoint project.  My goal was to dip a toe in the Rusty water, so to speak.  I didn't want to go swimming (or drown!).

I hope you find this work useful.
