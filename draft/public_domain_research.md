People need to stop and think about the ChainAnchor project without jumping to stark conclusions about its intent.

ChainAnchor is an experiment born in MIT. The project is lead by Sandy Pentland and company, who have a strong record in pursuing rights online. 
Pentland was awarded the [Brandeis Privacy Award in 2015](https://youtu.be/tXgLMj2Weig?t=15m6s).  He and a team are the authors of [Enigma](http://enigma.media.mit.edu).  This is a team that takes ethics seriously.

Pentland's group releases papers, as all academics do, to foster review and discussion.  They're not planting a flag and staking a claim as commercial ventures do.  

In the case of blockchains and cryptocurrency, practioners like Peter Todd *could* play an important role in that peer review process. However, [in this case](https://petertodd.org/2016/mit-chainanchor-bribing-miners-to-regulate-bitcoin) Todd responded in a public, inflammatory way.

Consider for a moment what an entirely academic-led peer review process would be like if controversial papers such as that about ChainAnchor were publicly attacked and its authors humiliated. This would quickly become an unsafe environment to explore and challenge ideas.

If academia is to partner with practitioners and experts, both groups are going to need to achieve a mutually beneficial arrangement to advance the field together. This is now a case of what such an arrangement *would not* look like.

The reason I am taking the time to talk about this episode is because the problems that MIT, Peter, and company are solving require collective action.  Academics play an important role and must be engaged as partners rather than adversaries.

Nip this issue in the bud now and move forward together.


*For the record: I currently have no commercial nor academic interests in this subject.  I am cheerleading the effort.*
